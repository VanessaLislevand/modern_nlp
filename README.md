# Modern NLP Reading Group at Stockholm University, DSV, 2021

This reading group is about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and we will be studying recent papers and investigating standard techniques. A notebook will follow each session, hosting experiments with regards to questions that came up during each presentation. Students will be able to extend these notebooks and upload the updated versions under a folder by their name.
